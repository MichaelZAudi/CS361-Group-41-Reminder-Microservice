# Reminder Microservice (Milestone 1)

Welcome to the Reminder Microservice! Users can create three types of reminders through the web interface and the node.js rest API, containing:
1.) Timed Reminders
2.) Event Reminders
3.) Recurring Reminders

Each reminder type has its own page with clear instructions, including a 'clear' button and a consistent layout.

# How to Run
1.) Install dependencies: npm install
2.) Start the server: node servier.js
3.) Open in browser: http://localhost:3000/index.html
4.) Navigate to each page via the navigation bar and follow the instructions accordingly on each page.

# Features
1.) Timed reminders which are activated after X seconds
2.) Event reminders which are activated when a named event is triggered
3.) Recurring reminders which are activated repeatedly for X recurrences
4.) Simple layout and interface with a navigation bar present on each page
5.) Clear fields that allow for users to reset all the entry boxes
